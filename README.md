# UAV Strategic Deconfliction System

## Overview
This project implements a strategic deconfliction system for UAVs to ensure safe execution of waypoint missions in shared airspace.

## Project Structure
- `code/`: Contains the Python modules for deconfliction logic and simulation.
- `data/`: Includes sample JSON files for drone missions.
- `docs/`: Design reflection and justification document.
- `visuals/`: Simulation outputs (graphs, images, GIFs).

## How to Run
1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python code/main.py
   ```

## Features
- Spatial and temporal conflict checks
- Conflict explanation
- Simulation visualization

## Extra
- Designed for scalability
- Modular architecture
